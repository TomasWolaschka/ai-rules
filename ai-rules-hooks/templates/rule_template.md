# {Technology} Best Practices ({Year})

## Overview

This document contains the latest best practices for {technology} development, updated for {year} based on community trends, official documentation, and industry standards.

## Core Principles

1. **Clean Code**: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain
2. **SOLID Principles**: Follow Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
3. **Consistent Style**: Maintain consistent formatting and naming conventions
4. **Documentation**: Document your code appropriately for future maintainers
5. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests to ensure code reliability

## Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Variables and functions: Use descriptive names
- Classes: Follow language-specific conventions
- Constants: Use appropriate naming patterns
- Files and modules: Use clear, descriptive names

### Code Organization
- Separate concerns into different modules/classes
- Keep functions and classes focused and small
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Maintain consistent file and directory structure

### Documentation
- Write clear, concise comments
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use appropriate documentation tools for the technology

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data appropriately
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Pin dependency versions appropriately
- Remove unused dependencies

### Secure Coding
- Follow secure coding practices
- Avoid common security vulnerabilities
- Use secure communication protocols
- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for individual components
- Implement integration tests for system interactions
- Use end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Maintain good test coverage (aim for 80%+)

### Quality Metrics
- Use code quality tools and linters
- Monitor code complexity metrics
- Track technical debt
- Implement continuous integration

## Performance Guidelines

### Optimization Techniques
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Optimize critical code paths

### Resource Management
- Manage memory usage effectively
- Handle resources properly (files, connections, etc.)
- Use appropriate concurrency patterns
- Monitor resource usage in production

## Modern Tooling and Ecosystem

### Development Tools
- Use modern IDEs with appropriate plugins
- Implement code formatting and linting tools
- Use version control effectively
- Set up proper debugging environments

### Build and Deployment
- Use automated build systems
- Implement continuous integration/deployment
- Use appropriate packaging and distribution methods
- Monitor application performance and errors

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Language Features
- Use modern language features appropriately
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Understand and use language idioms correctly
- Stay updated with language evolution

### Frameworks and Libraries
- Choose appropriate frameworks for the project
- Follow framework best practices
- Keep frameworks and libraries updated
- Understand the trade-offs of different choices

## Migration and Upgrade Guidelines

### Legacy Code
- Plan gradual migration strategies
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document migration procedures
- Test thoroughly during transitions

### Technology Updates
- Stay informed about technology updates
- Plan upgrade schedules appropriately
- Test upgrades in non-production environments first
- Have rollback procedures in place
