### SOLID Principles Implementation
**PRACTICE**: Follow SOLID principles for maintainable code

**ABSTRACTION**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extend functionality without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

### Design Patterns
- **IoC (Inversion of Control)**: Inject dependencies, don't hard-code
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common logic into reusable components
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions
- **Convention over Configuration**: Use naming conventions to reduce setup
